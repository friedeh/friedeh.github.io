There is overwhelming evidence for a positive effect of communication skills training. 

Simulated patients in communication skills training:

The usefulness of simulated patients has been investigated in a randomized study which showed that the students reacted similarly to real and to simulated patients (Sanson- Fisher {\&}amp; Poole, 1980).The authors conclude that simulated patients can be used in both the teaching and the examination of communication skills.

The `experiential{\textquoteright} method is first to do the interview oneself and later to receive feedback from the teacher. Experiential methods thus presuppose some form of recording of the student{\textquoteright}s interview, which is easiest done by video- or audiotaping.
The teaching method should be experiential as it has been shown conclusively that instructional methods do not give the desired results.The contents of communication skills courses should primarily be problem defining.

(The `instructional{\textquoteright} or `traditional{\textquoteright} method of learning communication skills in medicine is {\textregistered}rst to be shown how to do an interview by a teacher, either by lecture or by example, and then repeat it with or without feedback.)}

Praktische Fertigkeiten werden durch Internet-basiertes Lernen besser vermittelt als ohne Lernen (insbesondere in praktischer Lernumgebung wie Krankenhaus, etc und durch ein integriertes Angebot von praktischen {\"U}bungen)
Verhalten in der Praxis und positive Effekte auf das Patientenoutcome werden durch Internet-basiertes Lernen besser vermittelt als ohne Lernen (insbesondere mit einer Dauer von {\&}gt; 1 Woche und durch das Vorhandensein von Tutorials.

Zufriedenheit, Wissen, Praktische Fertigkeiten, Verhalten in der Praxis und positive Effekte auf das Patientenoutcome werden durch Internet-basiertes Lernen gleich gut vermittelt wie durch andere Lehrinterventionen.

Offene Fragen: "Wann sollte man Internet-basiertes Lernen einsetzen und wie sollte man es implementieren?"

Also: Internet-basiertes Lernen ist eine effektive Lehrintervention sowohl f{\"u}r Wissen, praktische Fertigkeiten, Verhalten in der Praxis und auch das Patientenoutcome. Dabei sind Tutorials f{\"u}r die Vermittlung von Wissen und Praktische {\"U}bungen als auch eine praktische Lernumgebung (z. B. Krankenhaus) f{\"u}r die Vermittlung von praktischen Fertigkeiten von besonderer Bedeutung. F{\"u}r das Verhalten in der Praxis und das Patientenoutcome ist die l{\"a}ngere Dauer ({\&}gt; 1 Woche) und das Vorhandensein von Tutorials von besonderer Bedeutung.
Internetbasiertes Lernen ist genauso gut wie andere Lehrinterventionen.}

annote = {Major issues emerging from the SWOT analysis as most likely to improve clinical education:
1. Integration of the learner - Learners can be encouraged to develop their capacity to integrate their knowledge of the basic and clinical sciences and apply it to patient care in authentic clinical settings
2. Equipping learners with survival skills - Well-prepared learners can survive in less student-friendly environments and make the best use of their learning opportunities. Assertiveness and time management skills should be part of the clinical cur- riculum, if not already included in earlier parts of the course. Similarly, students should know how to give good quality feedback, con{\textregistered}dent that they will be pro- tected against any backlash, since learners are reluctant
to give negative feedback in hierarchical settings.
 interpersonal skills, such as giving receiving and feedback; dealing with dif{\textregistered}cult and abusive staff or patients; being appropriately assertive;
{\textperiodcentered} coming to terms with illness and dying and dealing with other dif{\textregistered}cult situations including ethical dilemmas;
{\textperiodcentered} identifying positive coping strategies and sources of support and avoiding negative coping strategies;
{\textperiodcentered} making ef{\textregistered}cient and effective use of time and resources (see 3 below); and
{\textperiodcentered}	obtaining and managing information (see 4 below)
3. Better use of the environment and resources for learning - Clinical learning opportunities are unpredictable. They can be improved by turning `down time' into learning time; by increasing the number and range of learning opportunities and by increasing the amount of clinical learning time that is spent effectively
4. Expertise in using information technology to enhance clinical learning - A smooth transition from student learner to junior doctor may be enhanced if new graduates enter the health care system with well-established expertise in a range of IT applications.

Patients or standardized patients have been used for debriefing exercises, freeing up clinical teacher time for other types of interactions with the learners.

Theories of situated learning (Herrington J, Oliver R. Using situated learning and multi- media to investigate higher order thinking. J Interactive Learning Res 1999;10:3-24.) provide a base for developing instructional resources that re ̄ect the essential features of clinical settings and the way in which knowledge can be used to solve real clinical problems.}

"Feedback is the single most important ..."
Roldan 1996
Pugh 2002
The second and more recent review, by Issenberg et al. in 2005,16 examined all RCT and quasi-experimental trials carried out between 1969 and 2003, identifying 109 eligible studies that evaluated a high- fidelity medical simulator as a teaching intervention and measured learner outcomes quantitatively. The aim of the review was not to evaluate the effectiveness of simulators in comparison with other teaching methods, but to identify the features and applications that led to most effective learning. Few studies were published in the 1970s and 1980s; most of the growth in simulation-based research occurred in the 1990s. The period between the years 2000 and 2003 saw the publication of 57% of the total number of papers on the subject published to that point. An interesting observation made by the reviewers was that few articles cited research outside their particular field. For example, surgeons only referred to studies in surgical journals, and anaesthesiologists tended to cite only anaesthesiology literature. Few cited the general medical education literature, and much less attention was given to research in other professions or disciplines that utilise simulators as teaching tools, such the aviation, military and business industries.16 A variety of research designs were employed, with RCTs accounting for 35% of all publications. The number of research participants overall was quite low, with over half the studies involving less than 30 subjects. With regard to the strength of evidence for the effectiveness of medical simulators, the reviewers found that roughly 80% of study findings were equivocal and less than 20% reported clear results. None of the identified studies were considered to show unequivocal results. Qualitative analysis of the best available research evidence identified 10 features viewed as essential to effective learning with medical simulators. These included the provision of feedback, repetitive practice and integration with the curriculum. Despite acknowledging limitations with regard to inferences made about the efficacy of medical simulators and generalisability, the authors were convinced that the direction of the evidence is clear: high-technology simulations work under the right conditions{\~{O}} and should be utilised to complement training involving real patients.16}

annote = {The	strongest	validity	evidence	has	been	estab- lished for the Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX). Although many tools are available for the direct observation of clinical skills, validity evidence and description of educational outcomes are scarce. Of the 55 unique tools identified, 21 (38%) were imple- mented with students, 32 (58%) with residents or fellows, and 2 (the Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise [Mini- CEX] and 1 unnamed58) with both. The Mini-CEX was the most studied, with adaptations for pallia- tive care,37 ophthalmology,59,60 and car- diology41,61,62 and implementation in multispecialty settings.63
Direct observation of medical trainees by faculty remains a vital component of assessment across specialties. Assess- ment through observation provides on- going data on trainee performance with actual patients, and effective assess- ment helps medical educators meet their professional obligation to self-regulate effectively.105 
Enhanced supervision (with observation) can be associated with better patient care and faster ac- quisition of clinical skills by train- ees,106 and the 2008 Institute of Medi- cine report recommends greater supervision in medical education to im- prove patient safety and education.1 
Although we identified many tools available for direct observation of clini- cal skills, few have been thoroughly evaluated and tested. One tool, the Mini- CEX, has been implemented repeatedly with medical students, residents, and fel- lows across specialties. The 20 Mini- CEX studies illustrate how validity evidence can accrue and tool implemen- tation can be manipulated (ie, adding be- havioral anchors to increase score reliability and accuracy).20 Multiple pub- lications suggest the validity of Mini- CEX scores. 
However, observers need training to rate learners{\textquoteright} performance reliably and discriminate between performance lev- els.8 Randomized trials highlight the value of rater training and its effect on scores.22,23 Brief training is likely to be ineffective.19,22,23,77 Although rater train- ing may initially be resource- and time- intensive, these costs should be weighed against potential benefits gained in teaching quality and learning.18 }

annote = {For the standard t tests ANOVAs, and so on, it is the assumption of normality of the distribution of means, not of the data. The Central Limit Theorem shows that, for sample sizes greater than 5 or 10 per group, the means are approximately normally dis- tributed regardless of the original distribution.
Thus both theory and data converge on the conclusion that parametric methods examining differences between means, for sample sizes greater than 5, do not require the assumption of normality, and will yield nearly correct answers even for manifestly nonnormal and asymmetric distributions like exponentials.

Summary
Parametric statistics can be used with Likert data, with small sample sizes, with unequal variances, and with non-normal distributions, with no fear of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}coming to the wrong conclusion{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}. These findings are consistent with empirical literature dating back nearly 80 years. The controversy can cease (but likely won{\textquoteright}t).}

Clinical improvement:
Residents trained on laparoscopic surgery simulators showed improvement in procedural performance in the operating room. The other study showed that residents trained on simulators were more likely to adhere to the advanced cardiac life support protocol than those who received standard training for cardiac arrest patients.

Andere F{\"a}higkeiten:
In other areas of medical training, simula- tion has been demonstrated to lead to improvements in medical knowledge, comfort in procedures, and improvements in performance during retesting in simulated scenarios. Simulation has also been shown to be a reliable tool for assessing learners and for teaching topics such as teamwork and communication.

Gute Zitate:
The goal of simulation is to replicate patient care scenarios in a realistic environment for the purposes of feedback and assessment.

Argumentationskette:
Warum Simulation, war doch bisher gut {\&}gt; medizinische Welt hat sich ver{\"a}ndert: Patienten mehr ambulant, weniger Zeit f{\"u}r sie, k{\"u}rzere Liegedauer {\&}gt; Simulation weltweit akzeptiert aufgrund der Patientensicherheit

HISTORY OF THE MANNEQUIN SIMULATOR

The first mannequin used to teach airway and resusci- tative skills was developed by 2 anesthesiologists, Dr. Peter Safar, an American, and Dr. Bjorn Lind, a Nor- wegian, during the 1950s.8(Grenvik A, Schaefer J. From Resusci-Anne to Sim- Man: the evolution of simulators in medicine. Crit Care	Med	2004; 32(suppl): S56 {\textendash} S57.)Lind worked with a toy manufacturer to develop what has been known for over half a century as Resusci-Annie. Some 10 years later, Dr. Stephen Abrahamson, also from the United States, presented the advantages of training anes- thesiologists with his full-scale, computer-controlled human patient simulator.(Abrahamson S, Denson JS, Wolf RM. Effectiveness of a simulator in training anesthesiology residents. J Med Educ 1969; 44: 515{\textendash}519.) Toward the end of the 1980s, 2 teams of anesthesiologists, one from the University of Florida (Dr. Michael Good and Dr. John Gravenstein) and the other from Stanford (led by Gaba), developed a realistic mannequin simula- tion. They combined engineering skills and the idea of using simulation in education for team training and with the aim of improving patient safety. The result was an interactive, realistic patient simulator that could replicate the human response to various physiological and pharmacological interactions.(Cooper JB, Taqueti VR. A brief history of the develop- ment of mannequin simulators for clinical education and training. Qual Saf Health Care 2004; 13(suppl 1): i11 {\textendash} i18.) At the same time, Dr. Hans-Gerhard Schaefer and his colleagues in Basel, Switzerland developed full-scale simulators for crisis resource training of operating room teams.(Marsch S. Team oriented medical simulation. In: Hensen LC, Lee AC, eds. Simulators in Anesthesi- ology Education. New York, NY: Plenum Press; 1998; 51{\textendash}55.) Today, these high-fidelity mannequin simulators are capable of recreating physical exami- nation findings, including normal and abnormal heart and lung sounds, pupil diameter, sweating, and cyanosis, as well as physiological changes, such as changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.

The incorporation of the mannequins into a simulated clinical environment complete with monitors and medical equipment commonly found in real clinical scenarios allows participants the ability to suspend disbelief, thus creating a highly effective learning environment.(Bryson EO, Levine AI. The simulation theater: a the- oretical discussion of concepts and constructs that enhance learning. J Crit Care 2008; 23: 185{\textendash}187.)

In some ways, clinical skills would seem easier to master because students tend to remember 90% of what they do yet only 10% of what they read.(Croley WC, Rothenberg DM. Education of trainees in the intensive care unit. Crit Care Med 2007; 35(suppl): S117 {\textendash} S121.)

The ability to provide immediate directed feedback is the primary advantage of simulation. 

Traditional practice of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}see one, do one, teach one{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} may no longer be ethical.(Ziv A, Wolpe PR, Small SD, et al. Simulation-based medical education: an ethical imperative. Acad Med 2003;	78:	783 {\textendash} 788.)

Many clinical problems cannot be solved simply by identification of the diagnosis; they often require resource management and teamwork, 2 practical skills...}
